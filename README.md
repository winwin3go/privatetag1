## Cloudflare Platform Entry Point

All Cloudflare-related work (Workers, KV/R2/D1 data layers, GitHub → Cloudflare wiring) lives in `docs/cloudflare.md`, with an actionable provisioning prompt in `docs/cloudflare_prompt.md`. Start there before creating any new Worker or integration so the repo aligns with the org-level cf-foundation and template repos.
