# tag-core

Tag registry and action resolver service skeleton.

- Responsibility 1: Manage TagIDs and action configurations.
- Responsibility 2: Provide APIs consumed by `apps/` and other services.
- Responsibility 3: Coordinate with `pkg/x402-core` for shared logic.

Skeleton only; implementation will be added later.
